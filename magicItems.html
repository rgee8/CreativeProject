    <h1 class='welcome'>Magic Items</h1>

    <img class='mask' src='images/simpleMask.jpg' width='500px'/>
    <p class='theItem'>"The Wicked Mask" (Cursed item), could also be called "The Wolf's Mask", requires
      attunement: Charges - 3 Per day. Effects - as a bonus action you can put on
      the mask and take on  the appearance (and physical stats) of a dire wolf. With
      each kill the mask gains 1 charge (feasting on a corpse can also add one charge).
      Once the mask has 10 charges, the next time a humanoid puts on the mask they
      turn into a bloodthirsty werewolf. The only way to separate the mask and the
      user is to deliver the final blow to the werewolf with a silver weapon or
      through a use of "Remove Curse". "Remove Curse" will also work on the mask.
      Upon use of "Remove Curse" on the mask, the curse will be lifted, but the mask
      can only be use 2 times per day.</p>
    <p class='backStory'>Backstory: a young girl was being held captive by her abusive uncle who made
      her do strenuous work all day, every day. While traveling in the woods one evening
      the little girl happened to cross paths with a Druid who practiced the Circle
      of the Moon. When the two exchanged stories, the druid took pity on the young
      girl and gave her a special mask to escape from the horrible uncle in the form
      of a wolf. The only condition was that the young girl must bury the mask next
      to a tree and never seek it out again. The girl did as she was instructed, but
      soon greed and anger took control. She dug up the mask and donned it once more
      for the sole purpose of slaughtering her uncle. By then the mask had taken hold
      of her. She would don the mask to kill those who she thought deserved it, but
      the more she used it, the more the mask took hold and corrupted her thoughts.
      Eventually she determined that nobody deserved to live and put the mask on for
      final time, except this time she never planned on taking it off. The girl and
      the mask became one singular and malicious soul. Over the next 5 years the girl
      became a werewolf and the slaughtered over 120 people. Eventually a large group
      of brave adventurers went to slay the beast, but all died gruesome deaths. Luckily
      however, the weakened werewolf was slain by a cave bear in a territorial dispute
      after the werewolf tried to use the bear's cave to recover. But no one was
      brave enough to go try to find the corpse of the werewolf or attempt to try
      and kill it againâ€¦ at least until now (3 years later). </p>

      <img class = 'sword' src = 'images/darkSword.jpg'/>
      <p class = 'theItem2'>"The Sword of Hunger", requires attunement: Charges - 3
        times per day. Effects: +3 weapon, as an action you can target 2 creatures
        that you can see within 45 ft and are not constructs or undead. That creature
        must make a DC 18 constitution saving throw or receive 1 level of exhaustion.
        At the end of the creatures turn it must make a constitution saving throw
        again or gain another level of exhaustion. For every level of exhaustion the
        target already has the DC decreases by 1 for every level (1-3) and by 2 for
         every other level(4-6) . If a creature dies either through exhaustion or
         through another means while affected by this effect you may use your reaction
          and 2 charges to raise it as a lesser Wendigo for the next 10 minutes. You may
           only raise a creature if it has 4 or more levels of exhaustion. This lesser
           Wendigo will disintegrate after 10 minutes and will only obey the commands
           of the wielder. Whoever is attuned to this sword will be able to commune
           with the spirit of the lich. This will allow for them to ask questions
           for either information or to just talk. The spirit will not be able to directly
           influence the wielders actions through magical means.</p>
        <p class = 'backStory'>Backstory: Long ago a lich began to strive for a new
          army. One that was more powerful than the common undead. One that would
          mercilessly devour any in is path. His solution to this desire was a siphoning
          magic that would slowly drain away at a creatures stamina and both starve
          them to death and then raise them as Wendigo's. As the lich kept experimenting
          he realized that the effects were easy to shake off and that with improvements,
          hunger did not have to be the direct cause of death. From this he developed
          "The Sword of Hunger". As the spell wore away at the stamina of his victims
          he would strike them down and raise them so that they may join in his army.
          This lich ruled through fear and overwhelming force. Eventually the people
          turned to other forces. Clerics, hunters, warrior, and paladins came
          together to stop the lich. After many deaths on both sides they eventually broke through
          to the forces of the lich, destroyed their phylactery, and killed the lich.
          Slowly the army of Wendigo's dissolved into nothing. As a safety measure
          the clerics took the sword and weakened it's power as to not allow for
          history to repeat itself. Then they bound and buried the sword in and
          magically enchanted room to prevent its influence from escaping, then
          sealed it away. Little did they know that this sword was imbued with a
          small portion of the liches mind.<p>
