      <img class='wolf' src='images/wolfHowl.png'/>
      <p class='howl'>When the party enters the small town to the South West of the map they will
        find it has many guards as well as a makeshift wall made out of logs. The
        town will also be in a large clearing so that they have a clear view of the
        forest around them. The guards will be defensive and hesitant to let them in,
        but eventually will let them in. If the party relays that they are adventurers,
        then they will direct them to the town mayor to speak to directly. The mayor
        will be a old and frail, but still have a sort of lively hood and total
        nervousness/jitteriness about him. When the party tells them that they are
        adventurers looking to establish some sort of trade or other form of alliance
        he will seemed relieved. He will hastily agree to the offer, but only if they
         accomplish something for him. After that he will also hastily add that he
         will pay them handsomely and supply they with supplies if they seem hesitant.
         He will tell them of the town's past in which about 3 years ago a werewolf
         had plagued the land and killed over 120 people, but that it had not been
         seen in some time. He will ask them to venture into the forest and either
         see if the werewolf is dead or to kill it if it is not. He will offer 100
         GP to accomplish this as well as supply them with some silver weapons that
         they will be allowed to keep. If the party accepts he will provide them with
         a map of the forest and the approximate location of the werewolf's last
         known location  as well as the path a previous adventuring party took that
         never returned. The map will have details on the area in the forest as it
         was recorded before the arrival of the werewolf. If they venture into the
         forest to the last known location of the party they will find the corpses
         of 20 people who have rotted away to nothing but bones. However the armor,
         weapons, and other possessions they had are still on the bodies as people are
         too afraid to venture into the forest. All of the armor and weapons are too
         deteriorated to be properly used, but they will find an additional 35 GP, 62
         SP, and 87 CP. If there is a wizard in the party then I may add a book from
         another wizard with a spell in there. Will determine as time gets closer. If
         they look at the map they may be able to notice that there is a cave nearby
         (or through a DC 18 survival check or by spending enough time searching for
         clues as to where the werewolf may have gone and passing a DC 12 Investigation
         check, may adjust for which PC does what as they have different talents). When
         they find the cave they will encounter 3 brown bears. Once killing the bears
         or defeating them by other means they may search the cave. At the back of
         the cave they will find the corpse of a werewolf. There will be no meat, just
         bones. Beside it they will find a small wooden mask with two eye sockets cut
         out and the visage of a wolf carved into the surface. With a DC 15 arcana
         check they may know that it is a magic mask and requires attunement. The
         attuned person will learn that mask has the ability to turn the wearer into
         a dire wolf as a bonus action and revert back as another bonus action. If
         a wizard casts identify on the mask and passes a DC 22 arcana check they
         may learn that the mask is cursed, but will not know what they curse is. If
         the wizard succeeds a DC 28 arcana check after casting identify they will
         learn the curse. A druid may also make a Dc 23 history check to know what
         the mask is. Upon returning to the town and delivering the news that the
         werewolf is dead the town will celebrate. A large feast will be thrown in
         honor of the mayor will award them with 50 more GP than promised (for a
         total of 150gp) as well as let them keep the silver weapons. The mayor
         will sign any documents needed to establish the alliance happily and the
         group may return back to the home base with news of success.</p>
