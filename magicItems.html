    <h1 class='welcome'>Magic Items</h1>

    <img class='mask' src='images/simpleMask.jpg' width='500px'/>
    <p class='theItem'>"The Wicked Mask" (Cursed item), could also be called "The Wolf's Mask", requires
      attunement: Charges - 3 Per day. Effects - as a bonus action you can put on
      the mask and take on  the appearance (and physical stats) of a dire wolf. With
      each kill the mask gains 1 charge (feasting on a corpse can also add one charge).
      Once the mask has 10 charges, the next time a humanoid puts on the mask they
      turn into a bloodthirsty werewolf. The only way to separate the mask and the
      user is to deliver the final blow to the werewolf with a silver weapon or
      through a use of "Remove Curse". "Remove Curse" will also work on the mask.
      Upon use of "Remove Curse" on the mask, the curse will be lifted, but the mask
      can only be use 2 times per day.</p>
    <p class='backStory'>Backstory: a young girl was being held captive by her abusive uncle who made
      her do strenuous work all day, every day. While traveling in the woods one evening
      the little girl happened to cross paths with a Druid who practiced the Circle
      of the Moon. When the two exchanged stories, the druid took pity on the young
      girl and gave her a special mask to escape from the horrible uncle in the form
      of a wolf. The only condition was that the young girl must bury the mask next
      to a tree and never seek it out again. The girl did as she was instructed, but
      soon greed and anger took control. She dug up the mask and donned it once more
      for the sole purpose of slaughtering her uncle. By then the mask had taken hold
      of her. She would don the mask to kill those who she thought deserved it, but
      the more she used it, the more the mask took hold and corrupted her thoughts.
      Eventually she determined that nobody deserved to live and put the mask on for
      final time, except this time she never planned on taking it off. The girl and
      the mask became one singular and malicious soul. Over the next 5 years the girl
      became a werewolf and the slaughtered over 120 people. Eventually a large group
      of brave adventurers went to slay the beast, but all died gruesome deaths. Luckily
      however, the weakened werewolf was slain by a cave bear in a territorial dispute
      after the werewolf tried to use the bear's cave to recover. But no one was
      brave enough to go try to find the corpse of the werewolf or attempt to try
      and kill it againâ€¦ at least until now (3 years later). </p>
