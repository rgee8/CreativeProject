    <h1 class='welcome'>Welcome to the World of Geotheda, a World Left in Ruin</h1>

    <img class='logo' src='images/geotheda.png' width='600px'/>

    <p class='intro'>Geotheda is a post-apocolyptic world setting that follows what is simply called 'the Calamity'.
      Now the remains of humanity are struggling to survive. You must unite the last bits of civilization
      so that humanity may begin to grow once again. However this is easier said then done. There are
      evil forces that are constantly working against you. Through the chaos a corruption is slowly
      spreading across the land which will soon consume all you know in darkness.</p>

      my Dungeons and Dragons world that I am creating</p>
