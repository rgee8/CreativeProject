    <p class='mapName'>The Map of Geotheda and it's Enviornment</p>
    <img class='mainMap' src='images/Geotheda.jpg' width='1000px'/>
    <p class='worldDescription'>Once upon a time this was a vibrant and diverse world. But ever since the calamity <br>
      the world has changed. What once was a small desert spread throughout half the <br>
      continent as all life in nature was drained. Now it is home to a large desert to <br>
      the East, the plains and forest to the West, a tundra and mountain range to the <br>
      North, and an island to the North West.<p>

    <p class='mapName'>The Map of the Corrupted Island</p>\
    <img class='differentMap'src='images/TheCorruptedIsland.jpg' width='1000px'/>
    <p class = 'calamity'> This is the source of the calamity. Now it is a floating island of dark crystal
      and corrupted earth. The corrupted land is now home to an increased amount of monsters
      as well as a dark castle standing ominously in the center of the island. Little
      does anyone know, but this is the source of the corruption. Underneath this castle
      stands a portal that leads to the Shadowfell, a world of shadow, which is slowly
      enveloing the world in shadows.</p>

    <p>As I create more maps I will update the maps. This will probably be a regulary updated
      as I create more</p>
