      <p class='sideMission'>The Anguished Howl, Lv. 5 Side quest<p>
      <img class='wolf' src='images/wolfHowl.png'/>
      <p class='howl'>When the party enters the small town to the South West of the map they will
        find it has many guards as well as a makeshift wall made out of logs. The
        town will also be in a large clearing so that they have a clear view of the
        forest around them. The guards will be defensive and hesitant to let them in,
        but eventually will let them in. If the party relays that they are adventurers,
        then they will direct them to the town mayor to speak to directly. The mayor
        will be a old and frail, but still have a sort of lively hood and total
        nervousness/jitteriness about him. When the party tells them that they are
        adventurers looking to establish some sort of trade or other form of alliance
        he will seemed relieved. He will hastily agree to the offer, but only if they
         accomplish something for him. After that he will also hastily add that he
         will pay them handsomely and supply they with supplies if they seem hesitant.
         He will tell them of the town's past in which about 3 years ago a werewolf
         had plagued the land and killed over 120 people, but that it had not been
         seen in some time. He will ask them to venture into the forest and either
         see if the werewolf is dead or to kill it if it is not. He will offer 100
         GP to accomplish this as well as supply them with some silver weapons that
         they will be allowed to keep. If the party accepts he will provide them with
         a map of the forest and the approximate location of the werewolf's last
         known location  as well as the path a previous adventuring party took that
         never returned. The map will have details on the area in the forest as it
         was recorded before the arrival of the werewolf. If they venture into the
         forest to the last known location of the party they will find the corpses
         of 20 people who have rotted away to nothing but bones. However the armor,
         weapons, and other possessions they had are still on the bodies as people are
         too afraid to venture into the forest. All of the armor and weapons are too
         deteriorated to be properly used, but they will find an additional 35 GP, 62
         SP, and 87 CP. If there is a wizard in the party then I may add a book from
         another wizard with a spell in there. Will determine as time gets closer. If
         they look at the map they may be able to notice that there is a cave nearby
         (or through a DC 18 survival check or by spending enough time searching for
         clues as to where the werewolf may have gone and passing a DC 12 Investigation
         check, may adjust for which PC does what as they have different talents). When
         they find the cave they will encounter 3 brown bears. Once killing the bears
         or defeating them by other means they may search the cave. At the back of
         the cave they will find the corpse of a werewolf. There will be no meat, just
         bones. Beside it they will find a small wooden mask with two eye sockets cut
         out and the visage of a wolf carved into the surface. With a DC 15 arcana
         check they may know that it is a magic mask and requires attunement. The
         attuned person will learn that mask has the ability to turn the wearer into
         a dire wolf as a bonus action and revert back as another bonus action. If
         a wizard casts identify on the mask and passes a DC 22 arcana check they
         may learn that the mask is cursed, but will not know what they curse is. If
         the wizard succeeds a DC 28 arcana check after casting identify they will
         learn the curse. A druid may also make a Dc 23 history check to know what
         the mask is. Upon returning to the town and delivering the news that the
         werewolf is dead the town will celebrate. A large feast will be thrown in
         honor of the mayor will award them with 50 more GP than promised (for a
         total of 150gp) as well as let them keep the silver weapons. The mayor
         will sign any documents needed to establish the alliance happily and the
         group may return back to the home base with news of success.</p>

        <p class='sideMission'>The Cursed Homestead (lv10)</p>
        <img class='crops' src='images/crops.jpg'/>
        <p class='howl'>As the party is exploring the corrupted section
          of Geotheda they will happen across a homestead that has 3 buildings (1
          two story, a small shed, and what seems to be the remains of a rather
          large inn), with a large farm. If the party searches the farm area first
          (which still has the dying remains of  corn stalks making it hard to see
          more than 10 ft) and passing a DC 16 Investigation check or spending enough
          time looking, they will find 20 bodies arranged in a circular pattern
          with the bodies pointing outward. All of the bodies seems to have been
          eaten off from with some limbs missing and chunks of skin missing. At
          this time storm clouds will begin to form and a light drizzle will start
          to fall. The party will then hear cries for help that sound like the cries of a young child, however these are mimicry from a Wendigo. If they pass a DC 17 Insight check they will notice that one of the bodies is a young boy and that something seems off. If they choose to follow the sound they will be ambushed by a Wendigo that seems weaker, like it is not fully transformed. If they investigate the buildings first they will find in the tavern 10 rooms each with 3 small beds in each room. In 8 of the rooms they will find the belongings of past residents,
          the doors to these rooms seem to be smashed inwards as well as there seemed
          to have been a struggle. In one they will find 25 gp, 32 sp, and 2 set
          of fine clothes (each worth 50 gp) but with some wear and tear on them
          (minimal). Another room will have a dented set of plate armor (can be
          repaired for 60 gp, but will have -1 ac until fixed) along with two standard
          swords and shields. In another room lies what is left of a wizard's spellbook
          (will not be able to learn new spells, but can be sold to a Mage's guild
          for 100 gp). There will be some food scavengable here, but most of it will
          be rotten. In the small house they will find mostly commoner and farmer
          clothes. There will be some more food, but not much. Lastly there will be
          the small shed. Along the walls seems to be mostly just farmer tools, with
          some sacks scattered about. In the middle of this floor is a large 10 ft
          diameter manmade hole that slopes after about 40 ft down. It seems to have
          been dug out with both shovels and hands. At the bottom of this hole is a
          large spherical room that is made of ancient stone bricks. In the center of
          this room sits a sword that is bound by chains that would be connected to
          the floor, but are broken. Most chains look like they have broken over a long
          period of time, but one chain looks like it was broken very recently. As
          the party inspects the sword they will be ambushed by Wendigo's with one
          being larger than the others and overall appearing more fierce. After defeating
          the Wendigo's they will be able to continue inspecting the sword or the room.
          Around the room are intricate carvings that show the history of the sword (will
          be written in another tab), they will have the option to either take or destroy
          the sword (The Sword of Hunger). </p>
